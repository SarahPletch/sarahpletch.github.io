        <h1 id="crispyonions">CRISPY ONIONS: THE PERFECT CRUNCH</h1>

        <p>
            Let's kick things off with those irresistible crispy onions that 
            add a satisfying crunch to each bite! Start by soaking thinly 
            sliced yellow onions in buttermilk for about 10-15 minutes. This s
            tep not only enhances the flavor but also helps the flour adhere 
            better when frying. While the onions soak, heat up some vegetable 
            oil in a deep skillet to a sizzling 350°F.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Once the onions are ready, drain them and toss them in a mixture of 
            flour and a sprinkle of salt. Fry them in small batches until 
            they're golden brown and crispy—this usually takes just a few 
            minutes. Be sure to set them aside on paper towels to absorb any 
            excess oil. These crispy gems are the perfect topping that adds 
            texture and flavor to your sandwich!
        </p>

        <h1 id="caesardressing">WHIPPING UP THE CREAMY CAESAR DRESSING</h1>

        <p>
            Now, let's talk dressing! This creamy Caesar dressing is the star 
            of the show, giving your kale that delicious creamy flavor from 
            scratch. In a bowl, combine mayonnaise, buttermilk, lemon juice, 
            Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, yellow mustard, anchovy paste, 
            dried parsley, and black pepper.
        </p>

        <p>
            Adjust the seasoning to your liking, and don't forget to fold in 
            some freshly grated parmesan for an extra cheesy kick. You can also 
            add in some pecorino romano if you'd like. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To make this recipe easier, you could always use your favorite 
            store-bought Caesar dressing. You can also make the dressing in 
            advance and store it in a jar in the fridge.
        </p>

        <h1 id="chickencutlets">PERFECTING THE CHICKEN CUTLETS</h1>

        <p>
            Next up are the chicken cutlets! You can buy pre-thinly sliced 
            chicken breasts from the store to save time, or you can easily 
            prepare them at home. If you choose to cut your own, start with 
            whole chicken breasts and slice them in half horizontally to create 
            thinner cutlets. This helps them cook more evenly and ensures they 
            stay juicy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have your chicken cutlets ready, pound them to an even 
            thickness for that perfect fry. Setting up a dredging station will 
            make this process a breeze. Start with a bowl of flour for dredging, 
            and then prepare your wet batter by whisking together an egg, 
            Italian seasoning, parmesan, salt, and pepper.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the dry batter, mix plain breadcrumbs, Panko breadcrumbs, 
            grated parmesan, and a mix of herbs and spices. Dip each chicken 
            cutlet first in the flour, then in the wet batter, and finally coat 
            them in the dry batter. This three-step process ensures a crispy 
            exterior that seals in all that juicy goodness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fry the chicken cutlets in hot oil until they are golden and cooked 
            through. The aroma alone will have you drooling! If you're looking 
            to make this healthier, you can air-fry the cutlets instead for a 
            lighter version that still delivers on flavor.
        </p>

        <h1 id="assembling">TOSSING THE KALE AND ASSEMBLING THE SANDWICH</h1>

        <p>
            Now for the fun part—assembling your sandwich! Start by tossing 
            fresh, chopped kale with a generous amount of your creamy Caesar 
            dressing until it's well-coated. This will give the kale a 
            flavorful boost, making it a delicious addition to your sandwich.
        </p>

        <p>
            To assemble, place a crispy chicken cutlet on the bottom half of a 
            toasted bun. Then, pile on the dressed kale and finish with a 
            generous sprinkle of crispy onions. For an extra touch of decadence, 
            shave some fresh pecorino or parmesan over the top before adding 
            another chicken cutlet on top and the other half of the bun. 
            Sprinkle lots of pecorino romano in the sandwich or on the outside 
            for more flavor! I also like to spread some Caesar dressing on both 
            halves of the toasted sesame bun to make the sandwich more saucy. 
            There's nothing worse than a dry sandwich.
        </p>

        <h1 id="tips">TIPS AND VARIATIONS</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Leftovers:</b> If you have any leftover chicken cutlets, 
                they can be stored in the fridge for a few days. Simply reheat 
                them in the oven or air fryer to maintain their crispiness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Make Ahead:</b> You can prep the crispy onions and dressing 
                a day in advance to save time on the day you plan to serve the 
                sandwiches. Just store them in separate containers in the 
                fridge.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Variations:</b> Feel free to switch up the greens! Spinach 
                or arugula can be used instead of kale for a different flavor 
                profile. You can also add sliced tomatoes, pickles, or avocado 
                for an extra layer of deliciousness. For a spicier kick, 
                consider adding pepperoncinis.

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

        <p><b>STEP 1: MAKE THE CRISPY ONIONS</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Soak the thinly sliced onions in buttermilk for 10-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or saucepan 
                over medium-high heat to about 350°F.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the flour with a sprinkle of salt.</li>
            <li>
                Drain the onion slices from the buttermilk, dredge them in the 
                flour mixture, and shake off any excess.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry the onions in batches in the hot oil until golden and 
                crispy, about 4-5 minutes per batch. Set aside on paper towels
                to drain any excess oil.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b>STEP 2: PREPARE THE CAESAR DRESSING</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, lemon 
                juice, Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, mustard, anchovy 
                paste, dried parsley, black pepper, and grated parmesan. Once 
                smooth, set aside.
            </li>            
        </ol>

        <p><b>STEP 3: BREAD AND FRY THE CHICKEN CULTLETS</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare the chicken cutlets by pounding each piece to even 
                thickness if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set up the dredging station. For the <b>Flour Batter</b>: Place 
                all-purpose flour with salt and black pepper in a shallow bowl. 
                For the <b>Wet Batter</b>: In another bowl, beat the egg with 
                Italian seasoning, parmesan, salt, and black pepper. For the 
                <b>Dry Batter</b>: In a third bowl, mix plain breadcrumbs, 
                Panko breadcrumbs, grated parmesan, Italian seasoning, oregano, 
                dried parsley, salt, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip the floured cutlet into the wet batter, allowing any excess 
                to drip off.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, coat the cutlet in the dry batter mixture, pressing to 
                adhere.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat, then fry each breaded 
                chicken cutlet until golden and fully cooked, about 3-4 minutes 
                per side. Set aside on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>STEP 4: ASSEMBLE THE SANDWICH</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, toss the chopped kale with a few spoonfuls of 
                Caesar dressing until evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add extra caesar dressing on both sides of the toasted bread 
                and then place a fried chicken cutlet on the bottom half of 
                each sandwich roll or slice of bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the bottom side with the dressed kale, crispy onions, and 
                lots of pecorino romano.
            </li>
