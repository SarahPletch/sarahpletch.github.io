        <h2>Synopsis</h2>

        <p>
            In this adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved novel, Elizabeth Bennet 
            (Keira Knightley) lives with her mother, father and sisters in the 
            English countryside. As the eldest, she faces mounting pressure 
            from her parents to marry. When the outspoken Elizabeth is 
            introduced to the handsome and upper-class Mr. Darcy (Matthew 
            Macfadyen), sparks fly. Although there is obvious chemistry between 
            the two, Darcy's overly reserved nature threatens the fledgling 
            relationship.

        <p>
            After 19 years as a prisoner, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is freed 
            by Javert (Russell Crowe), the officer in charge of the prison 
            workforce. Valjean promptly breaks parole but later uses money from 
            stolen silver to reinvent himself as a mayor and factory owner. 
            Javert vows to bring Valjean back to prison. Eight years later, 
            Valjean becomes the guardian of a child named Cosette after her 
            mother's (Anne Hathaway) death, but Javert's relentless pursuit 
            means that peace will be a long time coming.
