                        Eragon is the first book in The Inheritance Cycle by 
                        American fantasy writer Christopher Paolini. Paolini, 
                        born in 1983, began writing the novel after graduating 
                        from home school at the age of fifteen.[1] After 
                        writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a 
                        second year rewriting and fleshing out the story and 
                        characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 
                        2001 decided to self-publish Eragon;[2] Paolini spent a 
                        year traveling around the United States promoting the 
                        novel. The book was discovered by novelist Carl Hiaasen, 
                        who brought it to the attention of Alfred A. Knopf. The 
                        re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.
                        <br>
                        The book tells the story of a farm boy named Eragon, 
                        who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. The 
                        stone is revealed to be a dragon egg, and a dragon 
                        hose name is Saphira hatches from it. When the evil 
                        King Galbatorix finds out about the egg, he sends 
                        monstrous servants to acquire it, making Eragon and 
                        Saphira flee from their hometown with a storyteller 
                        named Brom. Brom, an old member of an extinct group of 
                        Dragon Riders, teaches Eragon about the ways of the 
                        Rider.
                        <br>
                        Eragon was the third-best-selling children's hardback 
                        book of 2003, and the second-best-selling paperback of 
                        2005. It placed on the New York Times Children's Books 
                        Best Seller list for 121 weeks and was adapted as a 
                        feature film of the same name that was released on 
                        December 15, 2006.

                <h3>Origins and publication</h3>
                <p>
                    Christopher Paolini started reading fantasy books when he 
                    was 10 years old. At the age of 14, as a hobby, he started 
                    writing a novel, endeavoring to create the sort of fantasy 
                    story that he himself would enjoy reading. However, he 
                    could not get beyond a few pages because he had "no idea" 
                    where he was going. He began reading everything he could a
                    bout the "art of writing", and then plotted the whole 
                    Inheritance Cycle book series. After a month of planning 
                    out the series, he started writing the draft of Eragon by 
                    hand. It was finished a year later, and Paolini began 
                    writing the second draft of the book.[3][4] After another 
                    year of editing, Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript. 
                    They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish 
                    the book through their small, home-based publishing company, 
                    Paolini International.[5] Paolini created the cover art for 
                    this edition of Eragon, which featured Saphira's eye on the 
                    cover. He also drew the maps inside the book.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paolini and his family toured across the United States 
                    promoting the book. He gave over 135 talks at bookshops, 
                    libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a 
                    medieval costume; but the book did not receive much 
                    attention. Paolini said he "would stand behind a table in 
                    (his) costume talking all day without a break and would 
                    sell maybe forty books in eight hours if (he) did really 
                    well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. (He) 
                    couldn't have gone on for very much longer."[3][7] In the 
                    summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on 
                    vacation in one of the cities that Paolini gave a talk in. 
                    While there, Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of Eragon that 
                    he "immediately loved".[3] He showed it to Hiaasen, who 
                    brought the book to the attention of the publishing house 
                    Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, 
                    contacted Paolini and his family to ask if they were 
                    interested in having Knopf publish Eragon. The answer was 
                    yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published 
                    Eragon in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude 
                    Palencar.[8]

                <h3>Inspiration and influences</h3>
                <p>
                    Paolini cites old myths, folk tales, medieval stories, the 
                    epic poem Beowulf, and authors J. R. R. Tolkien and E. R. 
                    Eddison as his biggest influences in writing. Other 
                    literary influences include David Eddings, Andre Norton, 
                    Brian Jacques, Anne McCaffrey, Raymond E. Feist, Mervyn 
                    Peake, Ursula K. Le Guin, Frank Herbert,[9] Philip Pullman, 
                    and Garth Nix. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ancient language used by the elves in Eragon is based 
                    "almost entirely" on Old Norse, German, Anglo Saxon, and 
                    Russian myth.[10] Paolini commented: "[I] did a god-awful 
                    amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. 
                    I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much 
                    older feel, using these words that had been around for 
                    centuries and centuries. I had a lot of fun with that."[11] 
                    Picking the right names for the characters and places was a 
                    process that could take "days, weeks, or even years". 
                    Paolini said: "if I have difficulty choosing the correct 
                    moniker, I use a placeholder name until a replacement 
                    suggests itself."[5] He added that he was "really lucky" w
                    ith the name Eragon, "because it's just dragon with one 
                    letter changed." Also, Paolini commented that he thought of 
                    both parts of the name "Eragon"—"era" and "gone"—as if the 
                    name itself changes the era in which the character lives. 
                    He thought the name fit the book perfectly, but some of the 
                    other names caused him "real headaches".[11]
